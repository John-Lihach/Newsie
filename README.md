A mobile application, written in React Native, that uses the Google News RSS feed to grab headlines. Comes with default topics, but also allows users to add custom ones.

The app contains five pages: A splash screen (Splash.js), a main content screen (Main.js), a settings screen (Settings.js), a contant-us screen (ContactUs.js), and an about-us screen (AboutUs.js).
